Welcome to MVAPICH documentation!
===================================

**MVAPICH** (pronounced as “em-vah-pich”) is an open-source MPI software
to exploit the novel features and mechanisms of high-performance
networking technologies (InfiniBand, iWARP, RDMA over Converged
Enhanced Ethernet (RoCE v1 and v2), Slingshot 10/11, and Rockport
Networks) and deliver best performance and scalability to MPI
applications. This Release Candidate of MVAPICH 4.0 adds support for
the Cray Slingshot 11, Cornelis OPX, and Intel PSM3 interconnects
through the OFI libfabric library, and for the UCX communication
